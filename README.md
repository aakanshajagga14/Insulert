According to recent statistics, approximately 9.3% of the global population is living with type 2 diabetes. The prevalence varies by region, with certain areas experiencing higher percentages. North America has one of the highest prevalence rates, with around 12.8% of the population affected. The Middle East and North Africa region also report elevated percentages, with approximately 11.7%. In the Asia-Pacific region, the prevalence is around 8.4%, while Europe reports a rate of about 6.9%. Sub-Saharan Africa has a lower prevalence, at approximately 3.8%, but the numbers are rising due to changing lifestyles and urbanization.

Diabetic retinopathy is caused by high blood sugar due to diabetes. Over time, having too much sugar in your blood can damage your retina — the part of your eye that detects light and sends signals to your brain through a nerve in the back of your eye (optic nerve). Diabetes damages blood vessels all over the body. The damage to your eyes starts when sugar blocks the tiny blood vessels that go to your retina, causing them to leak fluid or bleed. To make up for these blocked blood vessels, your eyes then grow new blood vessels that don’t work well. These new blood vessels can leak or bleed easily.

We will detect symptoms of diabetes with diabetic retinopathy. As the condition progresses, diabetic retinopathy symptoms may include:
1. Spots or dark strings floating in your vision (floaters)
2. Blurred vision
3. Fluctuating vision
4. Impaired color vision
5. Dark or empty areas in your vision
6. Vision loss
